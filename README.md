Java NOtes and cheat sheet I wrote during work and academia

Generic Java
---------------------

### 1. ArrayList
ArrayList is implemented based on primitive array 

Feature: 
ArrayList<T> myarrlist = new ArrayList<T>()
#### 1.Type Satety
compile time checking for correct type  impossible for array, but array provides run time checking

#### 2. Flexibility
ArrayList has Dynamic, and a better interface

#### 3. Size vs length
Size is the capacity
length is the actually length

#### 4. Multi-dimension
arraylist doesn't support multi-dimension, array does
